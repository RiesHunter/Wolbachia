# Wolbachia
Study of Zika virus evolution under Wolbachia selective pressure

## Project overview
- Mosquitoes fed on blood or ZIKV-infected mice
- Some mosquitoes were "infected" with Wmel (*Wolbachia sp.*); others were given Tetracycline ("Tet")
- We see reduced ZIKV dissemination (movement from midgut to legs to saliva) in the Wmel group
- We are interested in how the ZIKV population evolves during Wolbachia infection

## Goals
- Calculate Pi, PiN/PiS, mutation frequency, Gini-Simpson, and Shannon Entropy for all samples
- Compare metrics between Tet and Wmel over time
- Investigate bottleneck sizes through barcode analyses
