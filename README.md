# Wolbachia
Study of Zika virus evolution under Wolbachia selective pressure

## Project overview
 - Mosquitoes fed on blood or ZIKV-infected mice
 - Some mosquitoes were infected with Wmel (*Wolbachia sp.*); others were given Tetracycline ("Tet")
 - We see reduced ZIKV dissemination (movement from midgut to legs to saliva) in the Wmel group
 - We are interested in how the ZIKV population evolves during Wolbachia co-infection

## Goals
 - Calculate barcode frequencies
 - Compare Tet to Wmel over time
   - Nucleotide diversity
   - Barcode frequency
